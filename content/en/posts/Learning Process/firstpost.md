Hi, I'm Rasperon, and today we're going to talk about why I created this blog. Iâ€™ve been reading about the benefits of keeping a journal for a long time, and finally, I managed to overcome my laziness and create an online journal called 'Cipher Log.' Today may not be a very special day, but maybe one day if I become famous, people will say, 'Hey, Rasperon started this blog on December 8th.' Sounds crazy, haha. Today wasn't very productive, so the blog will stay empty for now. But from tomorrow, I'll fill this place every day. (I hope)
